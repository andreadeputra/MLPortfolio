# Predict Customer Clicked Ads Classification by Using Machine Learning
This project is part of Rakamin Academy's portfolio building. In this project, I am given a dataset about a customer database from a company. This company wants to evaluate the effectiveness of their ads. The goal of this project is to make a machine learning model to solve this company's problem in their marketing effort. 

## Customer Type and Behaviour Analysis on Advertisement
For the first step, I did some quick EDA to analyze the company's customerbase. For this project, the focus on the behaviour analysis will be mostly using the numerical features **Age**, **DailyTimeOnSite**, and **DailyNetUsage**.
The EDA consists of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Here are some findings and observations made from these EDA:
- Customers who didn't click on ad are mostly 35 years old or younger
- Customers who spends more time on the internet in general is less likely to click on ad
- Time spent on site is part of internet usage (possible redundancy)
- There is a negative correlation between age and time spent
