# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository will serve as an index to Data Science related projects for both completed works and currently ongoing works. This repository structure is inspired by [Dimitre Oliveira](https://github.com/dimitreOliveira) for his vast, well organized portfolios. I will update and adapt this repository as I build more projects.

## Projects:

### [Holiday Package Prediction](https://github.com/andreadeputra/Rakamin_Final_Project)
My team and I made a **classification model** based on a kaggle dataset to reduce marketing cost for holiday package as a final project for a bootcamp course. You can check the summary [here](https://github.com/andreadeputra/Rakamin_Final_Project/blob/main/README.md) (Bahasa only *for now*).

### [Investigate Hotel Business using Data Visualization](https://github.com/andreadeputra/MLPortfolio/tree/main/Courses/RakaminMiniProject/2.%20Investigate%20Hotel%20Business%20using%20Data%20Visualization)

### [Predict Customer Clicked Ads Classification by Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/andreadeputra/MLPortfolio/tree/main/Courses/RakaminMiniProject/4.%20Predict%20Customer%20Clicked%20Ads%20Classification%20by%20Using%20Machine%20Learning#predict-customer-clicked-ads-classification-by-using-machine-learning)

### [Improving Employee Retention by Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/andreadeputra/MLPortfolio/tree/main/Courses/RakaminMiniProject/5.%20Improving%20Employee%20Retention%20by%20Predicting%20Employee%20Attrition%20Using%20Machine%20Learning)
