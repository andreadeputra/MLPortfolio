# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository will serve as an index to Data Science related projects for both completed works and currently ongoing works. This repository structure is inspired by [Dimitre Oliveira](https://github.com/dimitreOliveira) for his vast, well organized portfolios. I will update and adapt this repository as I build more projects.

## Projects:

### [Holiday Package Prediction](https://github.com/andreadeputra/Rakamin_Final_Project)
My team and I made a **classification model** based on a kaggle dataset to reduce marketing cost for holiday package as a final project for a bootcamp course. You can check the summary [here](https://github.com/andreadeputra/Rakamin_Final_Project/blob/main/README.md) (Bahasa only *for now*).
